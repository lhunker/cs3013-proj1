doit Program

Lukas Hunker

To compile:
g++ -Wall -o doit doit.cpp

To run:
./doit <shell command> 
	To run one command
or
./doit
	To run in shell mode

Supports
-Running one command line argument
-Running in shell mode
-changing directories
-Running processes in the background
-Printing currently running jobs

Does not support
-Piping commands in
-Tab auto completion

Algorithm
For command line arguments - 
	take out first argument
	fork a new process and run command with execvp
	wait for completion and get stats with getrusage

For shell mode
	Wait for input
	Read line
	Read individual words into a vector using an input stream
	fork with process used for command line arguments

For Background tasks
	Same as above except
	Store starting time and info about process in a map
	When signaled that process has completed - print stats and remove from map
